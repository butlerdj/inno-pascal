Discontinued. It was fun but I don't have time to work on it anymore.

What is it?
-----------

Inno Pascal is a simple Pascal compiler for Win32. It produces compact, native-code x86 executables without requiring any external assemblers or linkers. It was written entirely from scratch; it is not based on any other existing compilers. Full source code is included under the GPL license.

At the present time, it's in an "experimental" phase. There aren't that many things it can do.
